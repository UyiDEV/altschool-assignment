                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name Omoruyi Emmanuel Osakue, ALT ID <strong>ALT/SOE/204/0172</strong>. I am a graduate of the University of Benin, where I studied Mechanical Engineering specifically Metallury and Material
                engineering. I am the first of four sibings and an indigin of Benin City,
                Edo State. I have loved machines and computers since I was a child. I longed to understand how they functioned, and more importantly, how I could make them work for me. 
                This curiosity fueled countless hours spent dismantling old electronics, tinkering with software, and teaching myself basic coding languages. 
                While there were occasional setbacks at the time, it only strengthened my resolve. so naturally, over time I gravitated towards software engineering 
                I am currently enrolled as a student at AltSchool Africa Software Engineering Karatu 2024, Cloud Engineering track.
                During Material Science studies, I independently pursued online courses and certifications in software engineering. 
                I thought about game design but soon discovered I much rather play games than develop them so I tried frontend engineering and then backend engineering 
                but none compared to the intricate dance of virtual machines, and networks, and the limitless scalability offered by the cloud captivated me. 
                I discovered a field where my love for problem-solving, my drive for self-improvement, and my desire to create a meaningful impact could converge.</p>
                <p>I applied to AltSchool because of it's innovative curriculum, collaborative environment and personalized learning. My goals are to follow the AltSchool curriculum
                and be guided in the word of Cloud Computing, a field involveing designing, buiding, and managing cloud computing systems.
                My vision for the future is crystal clear. I aim to become a highly skilled cloud engineer, building robust and scalable solutions across various industries. 
                The cloud's transformative potential fascinates me from streamlining healthcare systems to empowering small businesses and driving environmental sustainability. 
                Being in AltSchool has proved enlighting and empowering, and I have resolved to build a portfolio of real-world cloud solutions, showcasing my skills and giving me a crucial edge in the competitive job market. 
                This extends beyond myself â€” it's an investment in my community. I intend to share the knowledge I gain, mentor aspiring technologists, and contribute to open-source initiatives. My goal is to inspire others in Benin City,
                 particularly young women in STEM fields, to see that a fulfilling career in cloud technology is within their reach.</p>
